# Disease Mapping: BRD to ChEMBL ID Mapping and Data Merging

This repository contains two Python scripts for mapping BRD (Broad Institute) compound identifiers to ChEMBL IDs and merging the results with additional datasets.

## Files

### 1. `brd_to_chembl.py`
Maps BRD compound identifiers to ChEMBL IDs using the ChEMBL web service API.

**Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy chembl_webresource_client
```

### 2. `chembl_lincs_merge.py`
Merges datasets using ChEMBL IDs as the common identifier. 

**Input Files:**
- Cancer target drug data (following the instructions of the OpenTargets dataset processing pipeline)
- LINCS data with ChEMBL mappings (generated by `brd_to_chembl.py`)
